# OnePlayerSleep
spigot plugin inspired by the OnePlayerSleep datapack

**Configurable Sleep Messages**
We can add/remove messages at will, set custom text, hover text, and wakeup announcement text, and use bukkit color codes to spice things up! We can also set a custom chance for each message to be selected.

**Configurable Randomization**
by default, a sleep message is randomized once and distributed to relevant players. You can also randomize at distribution so that each player gets a potentially different randomly selected message.

**Async randomization**
Sleep messages and randomization are run asynchronously to maintain performance on the main thread.
