# OnePlayerSleep
spigot plugin inspired by the OnePlayerSleep datapack
Tired of waiting for everyone else to sleep? Now you can just get in bed to pass the night and clear those nasty thunderstorms! (as long as there are no objections)

## Configurable Random Sleep Messages
With this plugin, we can add any number of messages with custom text, custom hover text, custom wakeup text, and even bukkit color codes! </br>

Each message has a configurable chance to be selected, out of the sum of all message chance values.

## Async Randomization
Sleep messages and randomization are run asynchronously to maintain performance on the main thread.
